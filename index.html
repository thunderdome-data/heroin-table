            <h4>Not all states identify the drugs that cause fatal overdoses</h4>
            It's nearly impossible to know how many people have died from heroin overdoses in the United States, 
            largely because of variations in how medical examiners, coroners and doctors fill out death certificates. 
            In fact, many don't note what drugs contributed. This chart breaks down the percentage of overdose deaths 
            in each state, between 2008 and 2010, where a drug was identified.
